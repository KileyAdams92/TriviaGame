Project Title: TriviaGame

Getting Started:

This game is designed to be a trivia game (run on the browser) in which a person is presented with one question at a time. They are given 10 seconds to answer each question. They are then shown the correct answer and correlating gif for 5 seconds. After all the questions, the user is shown the results page which displays the number of correct answers/ incorrect answers/ and unanswered. A restart button is presented on the results page to restart the game. 

This game was challenging to make due to the addition of timers and updating the HTML with the timers.
